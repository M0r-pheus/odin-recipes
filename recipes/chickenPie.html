        </ul>
        <em>For the Pastry</em>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package store-bought puff pastry sheets (or homemade if preferred)</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C)</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add diced onions and minced garlic, sauté until softened</li>
                <li>Sprinkle flour over the sautéed onions and garlic, stirring constantly to create a roux</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk in the chicken broth and heavy cream, ensuring a smooth consistency. Cook until the mixture thickens</li>
                <li>Add diced chicken, mixed vegetables, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Stir until well combined. Simmer for a few minutes until the filling is heated through</li>
                <li>Roll out the puff pastry sheets on a floured surface. Line a pie dish with one sheet, leaving excess hanging over the edges.</li>
                <li>Pour the creamy chicken filling into the pastry-lined dish. Cover with the second puff pastry sheet, sealing the edges by crimping with a fork</li>
                <li>Brush the top of the pastry with the beaten egg to achieve a golden finish</li>
                <li>Cut a few slits on the top pastry to allow steam to escape during baking</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly</li>
                <li>Allow the Creamy Chicken Pie to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving
